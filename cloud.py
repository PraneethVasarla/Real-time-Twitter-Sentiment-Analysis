text="With the increasing use of technology, a lot of burden has also been considerably increased on the developers of the technology. So, most of the companies are now tending towards the latest and a revolutionising technology, the AI (artificial intelligence). Artificial intelligence has been around us for a while but most of us had never actually noticed it. If you are well aware of all the recent software advancements, you would have definitely heard about this. If you are not a technology freak…well, don’t think that you don’t know what the heck this AI is. Because AI is something which has surrounded us…in ways which we could never imagine. I will explain this with an example. When you add something to your cart on Amazon (Online shopping site) or flipkart or any other website like that, you find a section of the page giving you suggestions on what you may like. Now, the developers of the website would not have designed that, because they have no idea about what you like. But still the items shown in the ‘Products you may like’ always do make sense! Now that is achieved through artificial intelligence\nDeveloping machine learning  different developing other kind of software. AI has the ability to learn new things update itself. It takes in the information  improves its logic based on it. Now you may think what’s the use  this but yes, this definitely has a lot of application  the real world. Using AI makes the applications more interactive  user friendly. Artificiintelligence  something which man has dreamt very long ago. Many attempts were made to turn this dream into a reality. Some attempts failed but some lead to new discoveries.  AI began an ancient wish to forge the gods."
